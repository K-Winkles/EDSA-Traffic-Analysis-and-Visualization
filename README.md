## EDSA-Traffic-Analysis-and-Visualization

This mini-project is an exercise in the use of Python and some of its tools.

#### Data Extraction
  * Beautiful Soup
  * Scrapy
#### Analysis
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * (A little of) Scikit-learn
#### Visualization
  * Matplotlib

MMDA provides traffic data for all major lines in Metro Manila. For this mini-project, EDSA traffic data will be extracted, analyzed, and visualized from the following link: http://mmdatraffic.interaksyon.com/line-view-edsa.php. Since the data on-site updates periodically, this script is meant to collect the data within a certain timeframe. When the extracted data is deemed sufficient, the visualization of individual roads can then be executed. At this point, all the necessary data has been aquired. Then, analysis will be conducted based on the collected data.

Ideally, the mathematical models that will be applied during data analysis will process the data in a way that it "tells a story". These methods are applicable in numerous contexts that are useful both in theory and in practice as it offers an avenue to accurately predict future conditions. 
  
*Note: other unrelated scripts are simply practice scripts. I decided to keep these scripts for future reference.*

#### Additional Non-Core Changes to Follow: 
1. Line name fix
2. Fix scatter plot for overall traffic data since they overlap
